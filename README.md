# chat-me


A simple social media web app built with Vite + JavaScript. It features user authentication (login & signup), a feed with posts and comments, user profiles, and localStorage-based data handling. The project is structured with reusable components, clean separation of concerns (views, controllers, utils), and modern, responsive UI styling.
